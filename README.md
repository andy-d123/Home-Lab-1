# Homelab

## Objective

This Homelab is a diverse and structured environment designed to replicate a real-world network, as shown in the network topology. It will include multiple VLANs, firewall, SIEM, DFIR tools, IDS/IPS, various hosts and servers, an isolated analysis environment, etc. Everything will be documented, and this setup will continue to grow as I add more features and refine the environment.

## Inspiration/Guide

This homelab setup was inspired by [Building a Blue Team Homelab] by Marko Andrejic (alias facyber). You can check out the original guide here: [https://facyber.me/page3/]. As I was new to creating this, I used it as a foundation for creating my own homelab.
